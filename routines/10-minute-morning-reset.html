          <h1>A 10-Minute Morning Reset</h1>
          <p class="article-intro">
  If mornings feel like you’re already behind before your feet even hit the floor, this is for you.
  This isn’t a “perfect morning routine.” It’s a small, gentle reset you can do on low energy days
  — the kind that makes the rest of the day feel a tiny bit more possible.
</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
         <h2>Step One: Make the room feel a little kinder</h2>
<p>
  Before you do anything productive, change the environment by just one notch.
  Open a curtain. Turn on a lamp. Tidy exactly one surface. This isn’t about cleaning —
  it’s about signaling to your nervous system that you’re awake and safe.
</p>
<p>
  If that’s all you do this morning, it still counts.
</p>


         <h2>Step Two: Choose one anchor action</h2>
<p>
  Pick one small action you can do every morning, even on hard days.
  Make the bed halfway. Drink a glass of water. Feed the baby, then sit for one full minute.
</p>
<p>
  The goal isn’t momentum — it’s grounding. An anchor action gives your day a starting point
  without demanding energy you don’t have.
</p>

          <h2>Step Three: Decide what can wait</h2>
<p>
  Take a quiet moment to name one thing that does not need to happen today.
  Not forever — just not now. Letting something wait is also a form of care.
</p>
<p>
  When energy is limited, deciding what <em>not</em> to do can be more powerful than pushing through.
</p>

<p>
  This reset takes about ten minutes, but you can stop at any step.
  You’re not behind for needing it. You’re responding to your day with kindness —
  and that’s enough to begin.
